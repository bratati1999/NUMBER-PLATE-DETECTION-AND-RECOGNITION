# NUMBER-PLATE-DETECTION-AND-RECOGNITION
AIM :- Detect and extract number plate from a static image
EXPLANATION :- Vehicles in each country have a unique license number, which is written on its license plate. The system of vehicle number plate detection and recognition is used to detect the plates then make the recognition of the plate that is to extract the text from an image using modules that use location algorithms, segmentation plate, and character recognition. The main purpose of this project is to detect a license plate from an image provided by the camera. An efficient algorithm is developed to detect a license plate in various luminance conditions. This algorithm extracts the license plate data from an image and provides it as an input to the stage of Car License Plate Recognition. The image of a vehicle is given as input from the camera and the extracted image of the number plate can be seen on television for verification purposes. The project implements OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and image processing techniques using python. The project uses NumPy, OpenCV, matplot library, TensorFlow, and Py-tesseract OCR modules for this system.
